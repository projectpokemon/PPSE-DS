PPSE-DS
=======

Project Pokemon SAV Editor - DS

## Notes

This relies on the following:

### PokeLib
This is the pokemon ediiting library used by PPSE-DS. There might be a few missing functions in the version on Git. I have the other sources but I have not attempted to compile this in some time.

### libulx
This is an old defunct homebrew graphics library for NDS, which I then modified.
I have included an archive with the last version I could find back in 2012.

### devkitpro
PPSE-DS was written with devkitpro for NDS. It unfortunately changed a lot during those years so it might not be compatible any more.
